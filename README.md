**Maxi code**
## THE TOPIC CHOOSEN : PUBLIC HEALTH
## THE TEAM MEMBERS  : SAI RISHI,HARSHITH
## THE NAME OF OUR CODE IS HEALTH MONITORS

### Our first update
**Our first update is that we came up with the idea of a bmi-caclculator,future hieght predictor and a otp accescible vaccine sheet**

### Bmi-calculator
>>>This a calculator which basically tells if you are *underweight,normal,overweight,obese and extremely obese.*
>>>This takes your weight and height and calculates wether you are fit or not.
>>>So this is way of keeping your health in control.
>>>We did this because during lockdown the rate of working out has reduced and keep track of your weight this helps a lot.

### Future Height Predictor
>>> This is a code which takes the input of your mother's and father's hieght and proccess your **future hieght**.
>>> Many people will be keen to know what height will they be at future.
>>>So this is an easy way of doing it and knowing your future hieght.
>>> We did this so that you can see how tall you become in your future and if you become more tall its not to late for exercising.

### OTP Accesisible Vaccine Sheet
>>>This means that ; the code takes your phone number and generate a random **4 digit otp**.
>>> So after entering your otp you can access the vaccine sheet .
>>> But if You enter the **Wrong** otp it will show that the otp is incorrect.
>>> We did like this because we did not woant anyone to mess the dates and confuse the vaccine dates.

### Our second update
**We have just kicked of on starting our power point presentation and our code is good progress**
>>>So now there is nothing much to tell but we have have started our designing of the ppt and we might be able to finish by the *second update deadline*.
>>>And the code we some small issues here and there but it is assured that it will be fixed.
>>>So now , we can go a little slowly because our code is nearly complete and we divided our work equally .

### Our third and last update 
>>> So now we have finished our ppt , code and finishing touches and now we are ready to pust it into the repository .
>>> So , we had created an emphasis on public health which we had repaired the problems in our second update and now we have modified it nicely
>>> now we have done our level best on our ppt and to extract it we we have made a pdf of the same ppt 
>>> We wish that this particular program will ome into action any moment.
>>> we are **90%** good to go to push our folders for the submission 

### Some additional things :
>>> We used the programing language of python its eay to use and is very helpful>
>>> We are hoping that everything goes on good
